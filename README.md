# E-Commerce App Template

Welcome to the E-Commerce App Template! This project is designed as a starting point for developers looking to build an e-commerce platform using React and Node.js. It serves both as a practical exercise for myself and as a template for others to customize and expand upon.
Please if you have any feedback do tell me, as this is my first MERN project.
